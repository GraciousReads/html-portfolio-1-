<h2>Favorite 10 Movies and Dramas</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Hunger Games</h3>
<p>Like this movie because it reminds me as a woman that there is nothing to difficult to handle and sometimes because of the people with love in our life we make sacrifies and give our all to protect them and keep them safe.</p>
<h3>Brilliant Legacy</h3>
<p>The first Asian drama I watched, it also taught me that sometimes we try to escape our fate, destiny or love, but don't matter how hard we try, if someone is meant to be with you then they would be with you, or if they were not meant to be yours then, don't matter how hard you try, they would just not be yours</p>
<h3>Mischeivous Kiss</h3>
<p>Another Asian drama that has taught me that, it is hard to always read everyone, because not everyone is an open book, however, their feelings do come to light at the right moment and time.</p>
<h3>Divergent</h3>
<p>A movie that shows us that not everyone are created in the same way, we are all made unique and sometimes we have to show our uniqueness, we need to take a stand for ourselves but don't give up after taking that stand.</p>
<h3>Lord Of The Rings</h3>
<p>Just loved the plot which shows that not everyone that says they are there for you, would actually stay with you all the way because along the way, you always get separated and sometimes we have to try to handle our own burdens ourselves.</p>
<h3>The Grinch</h3>
<p>WHo in the world would not love watching this furry green man keep trying to steal christmas every year only to realize that even the grumpiest person in the world still have a heart and can still fall in love.</p>
<h3>Home Alone</h3>
<p>Please do not say there is someone in the world that don't like watching this little guy trying to be a hero to protect his home, family honor and neighborhood.</p>
<h3>Sounds Of Music</h3>
<p>Love to hear those songs and Maria's beautiful voice. Especially the 'Melodies of Music', 'My favorite things' and 'Goodnight, Farewell' </p>
<h3>The 10 Commandments</h3>
<p>The great story from the Bible of how God delivered the Israelities from Egypt and His commandments for what they should do to stay obediant to Him.</p>
<h3>Taxi</h3>
<p>Just love Queen Latiffa and her comedy romance, as she shows that they is no limit to the professions that a woman can possible do.</p>
